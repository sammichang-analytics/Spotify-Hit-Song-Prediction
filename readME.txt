This study aimed to classify whether a song would become a hit. Classification measures depended on the popularity variable, in which a "hit" is popularity > 0.60.
Outcomes of the study showed that songs with high speechiness and loudness contributed to song popularity, 
but when including the number of twitter followers of the artist, accuracy rose almost 10%. It is evident that although there are common musical attributes
amongst hit songs, the easiest way to produce a hit song, is in fact, having a large fan base. This study used ML techniques: decision trees, random forest, 
naive bayes and KNN with SMOTE oversampling to remedy the problem of class imbalance.
